## 🌟 **What You'll Get**

### **🔍 Modality Analyzer Section**
- **Text Analysis**: Analyze sentences, paragraphs, and essays for alethic modality
- **Proportional Scoring**: Detailed scoring for necessity, possibility, and impossibility
- **Real-time Results**: Instant analysis with grammatical breakdown

### **🧮 Extended Modal Realism Calculator**
- **Yagisawa's Theory**: Full implementation of Extended Modal Realism
- **World Types**: Actual, Possible, Impossible, Concrete, and Abstract worlds
- **Advanced Connectives**: Extended modal operators and world relations
- **World Analysis**: Specialized analysis for different world types
- **Metaphysical Semantics**: Deep interpretation aligned with the theory

## 🎯 **Quick Test**

1. **Launch the app** (web or desktop)
2. **In the Modality Analyzer section**, try this example:
   ```
   It is necessary that all triangles have three sides. However, it might rain tomorrow.
   ```
3. **In the Extended Modal Realism Calculator**, try this template:
   - Click "Necessity Truth" template
   - Click "Evaluate Expression"
   - View the results in different tabs

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Desktop App Won't Start?**
- Make sure you have Node.js installed
- Try running `npm install` first
- Check that all files are present

### **Web Version Issues?**
- Double-click `launch-web.html` for direct access
- Or use `launch-web.bat` for web server
- Make sure no other apps are using ports 3000 or 8080

### **Both Versions Identical?**
- **YES!** Both versions have exactly the same code
- Same features, same interface, same functionality
- Choose whichever works better on your system

## 🌟 **Key Features to Explore**

### **Extended Modal Realism Templates**
- **Necessity Truth**: `∀w(□p → p)`
- **Impossible Worlds**: `∃w(¬p ∧ ◇p)`
- **Concrete Existence**: `∀x∀w(x ∈ w → ◻(x exists in w))`
- **Accessibility Relation**: `∀w1∀w2(w1Rw2 → (□p[w1] → p[w2]))`

### **World Type Analysis**
- **Actual World**: The world we inhabit
- **Possible Worlds**: Concrete worlds where logical laws hold
- **Impossible Worlds**: Concrete worlds that may violate logical laws
- **Concrete Worlds**: Spatiotemporal, causally connected worlds
- **Abstract Worlds**: Non-spatiotemporal, ideal worlds
