# Modality Analyzer - Windows Desktop Application

## Overview
Your web-based Modality Analyzer has been converted into a Windows desktop application using Electron. This allows users to download and install it as a native Windows application.

## What's Been Created

### Core Files
- **`main.js`** - Electron main process that creates the desktop window
- **`package.json`** - Contains Electron dependencies and build scripts
- **`build-instructions.md`** - This file with setup instructions

### Application Features
- **Native Windows Application** - Runs as a standalone desktop app
- **Window Management** - Proper window sizing (1200x900) with minimum constraints
- **Menu System** - File and View menus with standard shortcuts
- **All Original Functionality** - Complete modality analysis features preserved

## Building the Windows Executable

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js** - Download from https://nodejs.org/ (LTS version recommended)
2. **PowerShell Execution Policy** - You may need to run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

### Installation & Build Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to project directory
   cd C:\Users\hotst\CascadeProjects\modality-analyzer
   
   # Install Electron and build tools
   npm install
   ```

2. **Test the Application**
   ```bash
   # Run in development mode
   npm start
   ```

3. **Build Windows Installer**
   ```bash
   # Create Windows executable and installer
   npm run build-win
   ```

### Distribution Files
After building, you'll find in the `dist/` folder:
- **`Modality Analyzer Setup.exe`** - Windows installer
- **Unpacked application files** - For portable distribution

### Installer Features
- **NSIS Installer** - Professional Windows installer
- **Custom Install Directory** - Users can choose installation location
- **Desktop Shortcut** - Automatically created
- **Start Menu Entry** - Added to Windows Start Menu
- **Uninstaller** - Proper Windows uninstall support

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **PowerShell Execution Policy Error**
   - Run PowerShell as Administrator
   - Execute: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`

2. **Electron Import Error**
   - Delete `node_modules` folder
   - Run `npm install` again

3. **Build Fails**
   - Ensure all files are present
   - Check Windows Defender isn't blocking the build

### Alternative Run Methods
If `npm start` fails, try:
```bash
# Direct Electron execution
.\node_modules\.bin\electron.cmd .

# Or with PowerShell bypass
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "npm start"
```

```

## Next Steps
1. Test the application with `npm start`
2. Build the Windows installer with `npm run build-win`
3. Distribute the installer to users
4. Users can install and run as a native Windows application

The application maintains all original functionality while providing a native Windows experience with proper window management, menus, and installation support.
